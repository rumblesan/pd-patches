# Pure Data Patches

A repository to store all my patches and abstractions


## Description

You'll need to add the *abstractions* and *externals* folders to your PD path to have things *just work*.


This uses the rjlib as a submodule dependency, so if you don't already have that loaded, make sure to recursively clone when pulling it with git and add the *rjlib* folder to your paths as well.
